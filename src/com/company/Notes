Why we don't use local /personal  laptop/computer to host websites and testing framework;
1- i have to keep my laptop up and running all the time
2- Personal laptops /computers dont have enugh ram cpu power to entertain huge # of requests
3- Internet connection are not that good
4- Security is also a big problem when it comes to host services on local machines
for these reasons we use server
5- every one can easily access them through their personal laptops
============================

SDLC
1-BA interact with client- discuss the requirements(BA develop the SRS document
Software requirement specification
2- then these document will be shared with Architects QA leads.
Architects- design the whole project, what hardware, kind of language, how many classes, looks,
--Architects design the software requirement documents(SRD) and QA start planning and testing

4- once the SRDs are ready developers start working(coding) ad start building the application
5-this is where the development life cycle starts

DEVELOPER--
developers makes the website/project and makes it available to the testers
  1- (Story of developer)\\
   --once the application is developed on local/personal computer/laptop by developers they ask other developers or archtects to review theri code
   for any kind of mistakes and after that they push the code to git or
       any other version control system then they
       are deployed to the development server
   or dev server so that we are sure they request the dev ops or IT team to deploy the application to hte development server(Dev)
   so that they are sure application still works outside their laptops.

   2-Qa will request dev ops or IT team to deploy it to the QA server, ( we dont test on dev server, to avoid messing with the basic code)
   3- if every thing looks good all the test cases are passed QA will deploy it to the staging server
   4-Staging servers are replicas of production servers so that we can test the application in as possible as same environmnet as production
   -- if test cases fails QA will repost them to developer and whole cycles stars again
